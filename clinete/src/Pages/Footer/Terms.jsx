                <h1>Terms and Conditions for DeliGou Online Services </h1>
                <p>
                    <h2>
                        Last updated: March 13, 2017
                        (DeliGou address update: January 18, 2019; non-substantive update for accessibility: May 15, 2019; non-material update for clarification: June 20, 2022)
                    </h2>

                    <h6>Important: Please carefully read and understand these terms and conditions (“terms”). They contain an arbitration agreement, jury and class action waivers, limitations on DeliGou liability and other provisions that affect your legal rights.</h6>

                    <p>
                        By installing, accessing or using any websites, mobile apps, email newsletters and subscriptions, and other digital properties on which these terms are posted or referenced (together, “online services”), you are entering into a binding agreement with DeliGou USA, LLC ( “DeliGou”, “we” or “us”), which controls and operates the online services from its headquarters at 110 North Carpenter Street, Chicago, Illinois 60607.

                        Please also review the DeliGou Privacy Statement, which describes how we collect, use and share information. By accepting these terms, you also understand and agree these terms will govern any disputes arising out of or related to DeliGou Privacy Statement.
                    </p>

                    By accepting these terms, you understand and agree that, as stated in Section 9, you are waiving your right to resolve any dispute through other processes that could be available to you, such as court actions or administrative proceedings. It also means that you are waiving your rights to a trial by jury or to combine your dispute with others in a class action.

                    The online services are not intended to be used by, or targeted to, anyone under the age of 13 years old. You must be at least 13 years old to use the online services.

                    If you do not agree to these terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that DeliGou close any online services account that you have created. You can request account deletion by visiting the CCPA Rights Center and making a deletion request.
                    <h2>1. About the online services.</h2>
                    Availability of products and services.
                    <p>
                        DeliGou products and services are available in many parts of the world. However, the online services may describe products and services that are not available worldwide.
                        Obey the rules of the road.

                        Whenever you use the online services, you must obey the rules of the road and all applicable rules and regulations. You must not use the online services while driving or while behind the wheel or controls of a vehicle that is moving or not in “park”. In the interest of safety at all times, you should only use the online services when it is lawful and safe to do so.
                        You are responsible for your devices and accounts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are responsible for any devices, software and services needed to use the online services. DeliGou does not guarantee that the online services will fully function on any particular device or with any particular software. You are also responsible for any messaging and data charges, fees and taxes for your use of the online services, including when we communicate with you by text, email or other means that you choose. You may only use the online services with devices that you own or control and using only the authorized operating system (e.g., Apple iPhone OS for Apple devices). If you create an online services account, you are responsible for keeping the account secure and for all activity under the account. You can only use one online services account and must keep your account information accurate at all times.
                        DeliGou right to update or terminate the online services.

                        You understand and consent that (with or without notice) DeliGou may update, modify or terminate the online services (or your access to them) from time to time, including by pushing updates to (or removing functionality or access from) any DeliGou mobile app that you have installed on your device.
                        Updates to these terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DeliGou may also update these terms at any time and at its sole discretion. If DeliGou makes material changes to the terms, we will notify you by any reasonable means such as by posting the new terms in the online service. If you do not agree to the changed terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that DeliGou close any online services account that you have created. To close your account, you can visit ‘your profile’ and click ‘delete account’.
                        Independent businesses own and operate many restaurants.
                        While DeliGou operates and controls the online services, it is not responsible for the operation of most restaurants. Most restaurants are instead owned and operated by independent franchisees of DeliGou and some are operated by DeliGou subsidiaries (such franchisees and subsidiaries are together, “restaurants”). Each restaurant is solely and independently responsible for its legal and regulatory compliance, for any issues relating to the supply of the products to you, and for any employment related matters in the restaurant.
                        Links to job opportunities from the online services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DeliGou and all restaurants are equal opportunity employers committed to diverse workforces. The online services may provide links to job opportunities posted by DeliGou or restaurants. These opportunities are with the restaurant alone and not with DeliGou or its parent company (DeliGou Corporation). This means that the restaurant that posted the opportunity is alone responsible for setting the job requirements, all hiring decisions, and all other employment related matters in its business. Neither DeliGou nor its parent company receives a copy of any application you submit to a restaurant that is a franchisee, neither controls whether you receive an interview or are hired, and neither controls franchisees’ employment policies and practices. Neither DeliGou nor its parent company employs independent franchisees. If you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that franchisee, and not DeliGou or its parent company (DeliGou Corporation), will be your employer.

                    <h2>2. Our information practices and communications with you.</h2>
                    <p>
                        How we communicate with you.

                        Through the online services, you may opt in to receive emails, text messages to the mobile number you provide to us or push notifications from DeliGou. When you opt into any of these types of communications, you understand and consent that that you will receive marketing, transactional and other messages from DeliGou. DeliGou may use the information you have provided to us to communicate with you in accordance with DeliGou Privacy Statement and California Privacy Notice.
                        Opting out of communications generally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have a choice in how we communicate with you. You can generally find your communication preferences with instructions on how to opt out in the profile section of the online service that you use. You may also have the ability to change your communication preferences using your device settings. In addition, our communications themselves may include the opportunity to opt out. You understand and agree that you may need to separately manage your communication preferences for each communication method. For example, if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, you may still receive marketing text messages if you’ve opted in to receiving them. While we do our best to offer convenient methods for you to manage your communications preferences, you may need to separately adjust your preferences for each online service. Please note that for some account-related and transactional communications, the only way to stop receiving these communications may be to close your online services account. Lastly, please note that if you are receiving communications from a DeliGou franchisee, then you will need to opt out from them directly.
                        Additional information on text messages.

                        When you opt in to any of our text message programs, you understand that such text message programs are separately governed by DeliGou Text Messaging Program Terms & Conditions. You understand and consent that you will receive text messages from an automated system. You further understand that your consent is not required to make any purchase. If you wish to withdraw your consent and unsubscribe, please text STOP to the appropriate short code or visit www.mcdonalds.com/contact.

                    <h2>3. Sending orders to restaurants.</h2>
                    <p>
                        This section applies to any orders you place using the online services. Please read this section before you send any orders to restaurants using the online services. Please note that ordering may not be available in all online services. Please refer to the FAQs for more information on ordering.
                        About ordering.

                        The purpose of ordering is to provide customers with a convenient way of building orders for products in advance and submitting their orders by checking in at a participating restaurant. You must register an online services account in order to use ordering. Before you submit an order, you must register a credit card or debit card (either one, a “payment card”) to use with your orders. Not all restaurants may choose to make their products available via ordering. You may need to enable location services on your device in order for ordering to function properly.
                        Registering your payment method.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        DeliGou and the restaurants use third party providers to securely store your payment card information and process your payments to restaurants. You understand and agree that, when you register a payment card, DeliGou or its third party providers may verify that the payment card you registered is valid. You also understand and agree that when you use ordering to make a purchase from a restaurant, that restaurant will be the merchant of record. Restaurants may require information other than your order code to verify your purchase. You represent and warrant that you are of sufficient age and have all legal rights to use all payment cards you register.
                        You purchase products directly from restaurants.

                        When you use ordering, you submit orders directly to a participating restaurant and the contract for supplying the products will be between you and the restaurant that accepts your order. The restaurant where you collect your products is responsible for preparing the products and providing them to you. You further understand and agree that you are purchasing directly from restaurants (and not DeliGou or any other Members of the DeliGou system) and that neither DeliGou nor any other Members of the DeliGou System have any responsibility arising out of or related to any products that you purchase from restaurants using ordering. DeliGou Corporation (which is DeliGou parent company), its subsidiaries, affiliates, their franchisees, agents, representatives, and agencies and their officers, directors, and employees are together, “Members of the DeliGou System”.
                        About the products in the online services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All products are subject to availability at the restaurant where you collect your order. Some restaurants do not sell all products. Images of products and packaging on the online services are examples only and may not be identical to the product or packaging you receive from a restaurant. Differences may be due your device’s display of colors or factors such as the ingredients used, the supplier, the region of the country, and the season of the year.
                        About the prices in ordering.

                        Each restaurant independently determines its own prices and independently applies any additional taxes and fees as required by law. Certain offers and pricing may not be available for all orders at all locations. In the event you discover an error in the price of a product charged to you, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product to seek a refund of the difference.
                        Building, confirming and sending your order to a restaurant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can use ordering to build your order and send it to a participating restaurant that you select. You do not make your purchase until you check in at a restaurant, and your payment card will not be charged until you check in at a restaurant. Orders made must be collected in person from the restaurant.
                        Checking in at a restaurant and making your purchase.

                        You can check in at any participating restaurant, even if you selected a different restaurant when you built your order. You make your purchase from a restaurant when you complete your check in at that restaurant.
                        Updated order totals at check-in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Updated order totals at check-in can result from changes in products, pricing, taxes or other fees required by law due to your arrival at a different participating restaurant than you originally selected. Updated order totals can also result from the unavailability of certain products, changes in price, or other reasons.
                        Paying for your order.

                        You make your purchase when you complete your check in at a restaurant. When you complete your check in, you authorize the restaurant to process your order total (and if updated, your updated order total). The restaurant’s payment service provider will process your order total amount (and if updated, your updated order total amount) to the payment card you selected when you built your order. You may receive a notification within the ordering feature that the restaurant has accepted your order and is preparing it. You own the products after you have collected them.
                        Cancelling your order, refunds and your consumer rights.

                        You have the ability to update or abandon your order at any time until you check in your order at a restaurant. However, once you complete your check in at a restaurant, you cannot cancel it. If you desire to seek a refund for any reason, including if the products are unsatisfactory or other reasons, please contact the restaurant where you purchased the product regarding any refund due to you. Your legal rights in this respect are not affected by anything in these terms.
